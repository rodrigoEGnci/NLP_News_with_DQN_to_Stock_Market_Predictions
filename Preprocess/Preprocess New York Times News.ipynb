Judge D Irvin Couvillion rules that Burton W Kanter, one of nation's most prominent tax lawyers, was 'architect' of long-running kickback and tax-evasion scheme in which money was siphoned from funds managed by Prudential and Travelers insurance companies; concludes that Internal Revenue Service overwhelmingly proved its civil fraud case against Kanter; Tax Court holds that $13 million in kickbacks were paid from 1972 through 1988 by four developers and another man to Claude Ballard and Robert Lisle, who were senior executives with Prudential overseeing its real estate investments; court says Ballard and Lisle then steered financing and contracts to developers, and gave 10 percent of kickbacks to Kanter; says kickbacks were funneled to 'sham' companies that Kanter controlled; Kanter denies any wrongdoing and says he will appeal; photos (M)</td>\n",

       "8  Tax Lawyer Called Architect of a Tax-Evasion Scheme A Tax Court judge has ruled that one of the nation's most prominent tax lawyers, Burton W. Kanter of Chicago, was ''the architect'' of a long-running kickback and tax-evasion scheme in which money was siphoned from funds managed by the Prudential and Travelers insurance companies. Judge D Irvin Couvillion rules that Burton W Kanter, one of nation's most prominent tax lawyers, was 'architect' of long-running kickback and tax-evasion scheme in which money was siphoned from funds managed by Prudential and Travelers insurance companies; concludes that Internal Revenue Service overwhelmingly proved its civil fraud case against Kanter; Tax Court holds that $13 million in kickbacks were paid from 1972 through 1988 by four developers and another man to Claude Ballard and Robert Lisle, who were senior executives with Prudential overseeing its real estate investments; court says Ballard and Lisle then steered financing and contracts to developers, and gave 10 percent of kickbacks to Kanter; says kickbacks were funneled to 'sham' companies that Kanter controlled; Kanter denies any wrongdoing and says he will appeal; photos (M)   \n",
